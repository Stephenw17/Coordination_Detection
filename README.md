# Coordinated Group Detection

This tool helps identify coordinated groups based on social media data. It can be used to analyze social media datasets for coordinated activities. The main functionality includes detecting coordinated group activities within a specified time window and calculating user and group statistics, assuming that coordination can be defined as two or more accounts which disseminate an object, (e.g., post, hashtag, link, etc.), within a specified time range (*time window*) with a number of repeated occurences (*minimum repetitions*).

This project pulls from the great work conducted by the people at [CooRNet](https://github.com/fabiogiglietto/CooRnet.git)[^1],[^2],[^3], but instead of focusing primarily on coordinated link sharing, this tool empowers digital analysts who wish to examine other forms of coordination, e.g., **co-posting**, **co-sharing**, **hashtag inflation**., etc. This tool is therefore useful in research concerning co-posts or instances of co-posting where the same message or *similar*[^4] content are posted by multiple users. 

The small changes and optimizations include the following: 
1. Refactored to Python
2. Refactored to first filter minimimum repetitions prior to examining timestamp differences thus reducing compute loads.
3. Alterations to include a broader definition of *objects* to be investigates which can take on any form as detailed below. 

## Features

- Detects coordinated groups based on shared content within a time window.
- Filters users and content based on a minimum repetition threshold.
- Provides detailed group and user statistics.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stephenw17/coordinated-group-detection.git
cd coordinated-group-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note: Dependencies include `pandas`, `numpy`, and `tqdm` for progress updates.**

## Usage
Any part of a tweet, such as text, images, links, hashtags, or the entire message, can be considered an object for coordination. The most frequently observed form of coordination (whether organic or otherwise) is retweet coordination, which can be analyzed by setting columns in your data as follows:

```python
df_pre_coor_check = df.rename(
    columns={
        'sourcetweet_id': 'object_id', 
        'user_username': 'id_user', 
        'tweet_id': 'content_id', 
        'created_at': 'timestamp_share'
    }

```
In the above example we are using the `sourcetweet_id` column which represents the originally posted tweet's id as an object of interest. This could be done for processed text using the the text itself or even embeddings of the text if you intend to conduct cosine similarity analysis on the text (co-posting), hashtags present in the messages, or any other textual or meta-data related element.
